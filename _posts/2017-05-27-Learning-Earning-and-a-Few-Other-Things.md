Interesting. I finally got around to putting this old website together. It's really a journey in figuring out a lot of stuff. Its basic structure sits on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It gives me a great opportunity to write in Markdown everyday. Yep! You read right: **I will blog every *single* day**. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. I encourage you to try this too.
